# Data Analysis on Credit One Financial Dataset

## Executive Summary
This report outlines a step-by-step data analysis process using the Credit_One_Finance dataset. The primary objective of this analysis is to explore and identify key trends and insights that can help financial institutions understand factors influencing default payments, bill amounts, and payment behaviors. Through a combination of data import, cleaning, transformation, and advanced visualization techniques, the analysis focuses on demographic and financial factors like age, education, gender, and credit balances.

## Key findings include:

Default Payment Trends: Younger individuals (20-30 years old) with lower education levels are more likely to default on payments. Males tend to default more often than females in certain age groups.
Bill Amount Analysis: Individuals with higher education levels tend to have higher bill amounts, suggesting that they may have higher credit limits or spending capacity.
Payment Behavior: On average, females tend to make higher payments than males, although this varies across months.
Based on these findings, several targeted recommendations have been provided, including interventions for high-risk age groups, gender-specific campaigns, and more flexible billing strategies for individuals with higher education levels.

The future work includes predictive model building (e.g., logistic regression or decision trees) to predict default likelihood and further investigation into more complex visualizations, such as heatmaps and scatter plots, to understand variable relationships. In-depth analysis of outliers and anomalies will also be conducted to refine risk management strategies.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the Credit_One_Finance dataset to uncover trends and insights related to credit card payments and defaults. The goal is to:

Understand Factors Influencing Default Payments: Investigate how demographic features (e.g., age, education, gender) and financial metrics (e.g., credit balance, payment amounts) affect the likelihood of defaulting on credit payments.

Identify Spending Patterns: Analyze how education levels influence total bill amounts and how gender impacts payment behavior.

Provide Data-Driven Recommendations: Offer actionable insights for financial institutions to better manage credit risk by targeting specific demographics with customized financial campaigns and billing strategies.

Future Predictive Modeling: Use statistical models and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of defaults based on key variables such as age, education, and credit balance.

Refine Data Analysis: Explore and investigate anomalies, outliers, and advanced visualizations to gain deeper insights into customer behavior and spending patterns.

## Step 1: Data Import and Cleaning
Data Import:

The dataset was imported into Excel, ensuring all relevant columns (e.g., LIMIT_BAL, SEX, EDUCATION, default payment next month, etc.) were included.
Data Cleaning:

## Missing Values: Any missing values were identified and handled either by imputing or removing rows based on business rules.
Data Type Check: Ensured all columns had the correct data types (e.g., numerical columns like LIMIT_BAL, BILL_AMT were set to numeric, categorical variables like SEX and EDUCATION were correctly identified).
Outliers: Analyzed for any outliers, especially in financial data (e.g., extremely high credit limits or amounts paid), and addressed accordingly.

## Data Transformation:
Age Grouping: Based on age (AGE), individuals were categorized into groups (e.g., 20-30, 31-40, etc.) to analyze trends more effectively.
Categorization: Converted EDUCATION and SEX columns into easily interpretable labels.
## Step 2: Creating Pivot Tables
Pivot Tables were used to summarize key variables and uncover trends in the data. Below are the steps taken for creating specific pivot tables:

Pivot Table 1: Default Payment by Age Group and Education Level
Row: Age Group

Column: EDUCATION

Values: default payment next month (Count)

Filter: SEX (optional)

## Interpretation:

This pivot table provides a breakdown of the count of individuals who defaulted on payments across different age groups and education levels. We can observe how age and education affect the likelihood of defaulting.
Pivot Table 2: Total Bill Amount by Education Level
Row: EDUCATION

Values: BILL_SEP, BILL_AUG, BILL_JULY, BILL_JUNE, BILL_MAY, BILL_APRIL (Sum)

Interpretation:

This pivot table helps to visualize how the total amount of bills varies across different education levels. It allows for identifying trends such as higher bills for individuals with higher education levels.
Pivot Table 3: Average Payment Amount by Sex
Row: SEX

Values: AMT_PAID_SEPT, AMT_PAID_AUG, AMT_PAID_JULY, AMT_PAID_JUNE, AMT_PAID_MAY, AMT_PAID_APRIL (Average)

## Interpretation:

This pivot table shows the average payment amount made by males and females across several months. It allows us to compare the payment behaviors of different genders.
## Step 3: Data Visualization using Pivot Charts
To better understand the data, we used various chart types to visualize the pivot table results.

Chart 1: Bar Chart for Default Payments by Age Group and Education Level
Chart Type: Bar Chart

Data Source: Pivot Table showing default payment counts by age group and education level.

## Interpretation:

This bar chart highlights the distribution of defaults across different age groups and education levels. We can easily see which age groups are more likely to default based on education level.
Chart 2: Column Chart for Total Bill Amount by Education Level
Chart Type: Column Chart

Data Source: Pivot Table showing total bill amounts by education level.

## Interpretation:

The column chart visually represents how the total bill amount varies across different education levels. This is useful for understanding spending patterns based on educational background.
Chart 3: Pie Chart for Average Payment Amount by Sex
Chart Type: Pie Chart

Data Source: Pivot Table showing average payment amounts by sex.

## Interpretation:

This pie chart visualizes the proportion of payments made by males versus females. It provides an overview of how the payment behavior differs by gender.
## Step 4: Key Insights and Findings
Default Payment Trends:

Age and Education: Younger individuals (20-30) with lower education levels are more likely to default on payments.
Gender Differences: Males tend to default more frequently than females in certain age groups.
Bill Amount Analysis:

Education and Spending: Individuals with higher education levels (e.g., graduate school) tend to have higher bill amounts, suggesting that they may have higher credit limits or spending capacity.
Payment Behavior:

Gender-based Payment Patterns: On average, females tend to make higher payments than males, although this varies by month.
## Step 5: Conclusions and Recommendations
Targeted Interventions:
For High-Risk Age Groups: The younger demographic, especially those with lower education, could benefit from targeted financial education or interventions to reduce the risk of defaulting.
Payment Monitoring:
Gender-Specific Campaigns: Financial institutions can create gender-specific campaigns to encourage timely payments, especially focusing on the segments with lower average payments.
Billing Strategies:
For individuals with higher education levels, consider offering higher credit limits or more flexible payment plans as they tend to have higher total bill amounts.

## Conclusion
This analysis of the Credit_One_Finance dataset provided valuable insights into the factors influencing payment behavior and default rates. Through data import, cleaning, transformation, and the creation of pivot tables, we successfully uncovered key trends and patterns in the dataset. The analysis revealed the following conclusions:

Default Payment Trends:

Younger individuals, particularly those in the 20-30 age group with lower education levels, are more likely to default on payments.
Males tend to default more frequently than females in certain age groups, suggesting that gender-based strategies might be effective in reducing default rates.
Bill Amount Analysis:

Higher education levels are associated with higher bill amounts, indicating that individuals with more advanced education may have greater access to credit or higher spending patterns.
Payment Behavior:

Gender differences in payment behavior were observed, with females generally making higher payments compared to males, although this varied across months.

## Recommendations for Future Action:
Targeted Interventions:

Focus on financial education or support for younger individuals, particularly those with lower education levels, to mitigate the risk of defaults.
Design financial campaigns that target specific age and gender demographics to address the unique payment behaviors observed in the dataset.
Payment Monitoring:

Financial institutions could implement gender-specific strategies to encourage timely payments, especially among male customers, who were more likely to default.
Billing Strategies:

For individuals with higher education levels, offering higher credit limits or more flexible payment options could better align with their greater financial capacity and spending habits.
